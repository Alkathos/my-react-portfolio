        <h4>About Me</h4>
          <p>I enjoy photography as a hobby and I also love to longboard by the beach. These two activities keep me sane and help my quality of life overall.</p> 
          <p>I'm from Florida but let's just say I live in Mount Olympus. I love anime, video games, Marvel/DC and all things nerdy.</p>
          <p>I attended American InterContinental University for Game Design Development and currently work as Warehouse Manager at Ryder. Turns out I have a knack for working with people, leading and hopefully be able to use these skills in future endeavors.</p>
